# Digits dataset
# --------------
#
# The digits dataset consists of 8x8
# pixel images of digits. The ``images`` attribute of the dataset stores
# 8x8 arrays of grayscale values for each image. We will use these arrays to
# visualize the first 4 images. The ``target`` attribute of the dataset stores
# the digit each image represents and this is included in the title of the 4
# plots below.
#
# Note: if we were working from image files (e.g., 'png' files), we would load
# them using :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.imread`.

digits = datasets.load_digits()

###############################################################################
# Classification
# --------------
#
# To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning
# each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape ``(8, 8)`` into shape
# ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape
# ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of images and
# ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.
#
# We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
# vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can
# subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples
# in the test subset.

# flatten the images
n_samples = len(digits.images)
data = digits.images.reshape((n_samples, -1))

# Create a classifier: a support vector classifier
clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001)

# Split data into 50% train and 50% test subsets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data, digits.target, test_size=0.5, shuffle=False
)

# Learn the digits on the train subset
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save model

pickle.dump(clf, open('model/sklearn-model/clf.model', 'wb'))
